    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at Denison University with a major in Data Analytics and a minor in Economics. As a data scientist with a liberal arts background, I have a passion for numbers and a curiosity about the world around me. I am interested in investigating topics not necessarily known for being quantifable. Do you have a position that requires some out of the box thinking and creative data analysis? Then you've found the right person!</p>
